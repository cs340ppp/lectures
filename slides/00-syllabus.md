# Overview

This course balances the imperative, object-oriented bent of the introductory
programming sequence by examining fundamental programming patterns through a
functional lens. Students will use Haskell to explore techniques that transcend
language boundaries: composing effects with monads, managing concurrency,
building domain-specific languages, and using property-based testing for
correctness. Programming assignments drawn from various domains will help
students recognize these patterns in modern frameworks and languages, developing
the judgment to select appropriate abstractions, data structures, and techniques
for the problems at hand. Prerequisite(s): CS 201 or CS 116 (concurrent ok)

# Learning Objectives

Students should be able to:

- Write substantial, well-typed programs using a purely functional programming
  language such as Haskell.

- Apply functional programming techniques such as recursion, higher order
  functions, and pattern matching to solve problems.

- Design and implement reusable, polymorphic data types and functional data
  structures.

- Use monads to compose and manage computational effects.

- Write asynchronous and concurrent programs using functional abstractions.

- Design and implement domain-specific languages for solving structured
  problems.

- Write and use property-based tests to verify program correctness.

# Topics

- Types and Type Systems

- Pattern Matching

- Currying and Partial Evaluation

- Recursion

- Lazy Evaluation

- Higher-Order Functions

- Parametric and Ad Hoc Polymorphism

- Algebraic Data Types and Functional Data Structures

- Monads

- Property-Based Testing

- Asynchronous and Concurrent Programming

# Prerequisites

Students are expected to be familiar with an imperative, statically-typed
procedural or object-oriented language, and to have written reasonably
sophisticated programs (500+ lines of code) with it.

# Assessments and Grading

Grades in the class are broken down as follows:

- 50%: Machine Problems (MPs)
- 25%: Midterm Exam
- 25%: Final Exam

The grade scale is:

- A ≥ 90%
- B ≥ 80%
- C ≥ 70%
- D ≥ 60%
- E < 60%

# Machine Problems

Each machine problem (MP) will ask you to implement a working software
application based on a high-level specification and set of functional
requirements. MPs will be released via GitHub Classroom, and submission will be
via shared, private Git repositories. Each MP writeup will detail its grading
criteria and point breakdown. MPs are weighted proportionally according to their
allotted points.

# Late Policy

In general, machine problems will not be accepted late for credit. I understand,
however, that circumstances may arise in life, school, and work that get in the
way of a timely submission. If you have a valid reason (i.e., not just
procrastination or time mismanagement) for needing an extra day or two, please
get in touch with me **before an assignment is due**, and we can discuss the
possibility of an extension.

# Academic Honesty

All machine problem submissions should be entirely your own. If we find evidence
of plagiarism, the first offense will result in the plagiarized assignment
receiving a 0 (for all parties involved). A second offense will be reported to
the Designated Dean of Academic Discipline, and may result in expulsion from the
class.

Please see the [Illinois Tech Code of Academic Honesty][honesty-code] for the
official policies and procedures governing academic integrity violations.

# On AI Use

Generative AI systems (like ChatGPT), if used correctly, can serve as powerful
tools for learning and idea refinement. In this course, you can use generative
AI systems to learn about concepts iteratively through a conversation (much like
you would have a conversation with a peer, TA or an instructor). However, you
cannot ask these systems to directly give you answers or write code for you. One
reason for this is because the answers that the system generates can be
inaccurate (no matter how confident the system might sound). But more
importantly, I believe the intellectual growth you can get from working through
a difficult problem and discovering the answer for yourself cannot be replicated
by just reading a pre-generated answer. Here are some concrete rules that
exemplify this (but are not intended to be comprehensive):

Do NOT:

- Give the model a problem description and ask it to sketch an algorithm for you
  or write pseudo code.
- Give the model the homework description and ask it to organize the code for
  you.
- Give the model a function description and ask it to generate code for you.
- Have your conversation with the model and your assignment open at the same
  time. Use your conversation with the AI as a learning experience, then close
  the interaction down, open your assignment, and let your assignment reflect
  your revised knowledge.
- Using the AI system in ways as described above will count as plagiarism even
  if you cite the AI system as a source.

You CAN:

- Ask clarification questions about the fundamentals of programming (e.g., “How
  do I use a callback function?”)
- Ask for conceptual clarifications (e.g., “What is the difference between
  synchronous and asynchronous code?”)
- Try to work through the logic of something you don’t understand (e.g., “Why is
  the run time of this algorithm (describe) n^2?”)
- Give a problem description and your proposed algorithm and “talk” through the
  potential fallacies.

# Disability Resources

Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented
disabilities. In order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter
of accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources. The Center for
Disability Resources is located in the Life Sciences Building, room 218,
312-567-5744 or <disabilities@iit.edu>.

# Sexual Harassment and Discrimination Information

Illinois Tech prohibits all sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and gender
discrimination by any member of our community. This includes harassment among
students, staff, or faculty. Sexual harassment of a student by a faculty member
or sexual harassment of an employee by a supervisor is particularly serious.
Such conduct may easily create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive
environment.

Illinois Tech encourages anyone experiencing sexual harassment or sexual
misconduct to speak with the Office of Title IX Compliance for information on
support options and the resolution process.

You can report sexual harassment electronically at
<https://iit.edu/incidentreport>, which may be completed anonymously. You may
additionally report by contacting the Title IX Coordinator, Virginia Foster at
<foster@iit.edu>.

For confidential support, you may reach Illinois Tech’s Confidential Advisor at
(773) 907-1062. You can also contact a licensed practitioner in Illinois Tech’s
Student Health and Wellness Center at <student.health@iit.edu> or 312-567-7550.

For a comprehensive list of resources regarding counseling services, medical
assistance, legal assistance and visa and immigration services, you can visit
the Office of Title IX Compliance website at

# On Changes to the Syllabus

This syllabus, like our course, should be seen as an evolving experience, and
from time to time changes might become necessary. I reserve the right to modify
this syllabus, with the stipulation that any changes will be communicated to the
entire class clearly and in writing.

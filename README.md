## CS 340 Lecture Repository

This repository contains sample code for CS 340: Patterns and Paradigms of Programming. Most source files are found under `src/`, and are numbered to correspond with lecture slide sets posted to Canvas.

I will likely be making changes to these files throughout the semester, so please be sure to pull the most recent changes before attending lecture. To avoid merge issues, I recommend you create a separate branch for your own additions and modifications so that you can always pull my changes into a pristine local branch.
